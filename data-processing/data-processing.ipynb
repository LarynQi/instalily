      "Thank you for voting!      Jones  July 20, 2017   My icemaker just stopped making ice and I know I need to replace the water filter ive just been dragging my feet about it. Is the icemaker cut off now because I need to replace my filter or is there another reason for it stopping now?     Hello Jones, we recommend replacing the water filter every 6 months, depending on how often you use it. Replacing or not replacing the filter would only affect the water dispenser, not the icemaker. The most common reason an icemaker does not get water would be a defective water valve WPW10270395. I hope this helps.    34 people found this helpful.   Was this helpful?

      "Check the fill tube and fill cup that brings water to the icemaker. It could be clogged with ice. If there is no ice obstructing the tube and cup, test the water inlet valve to be sure both ports on the valve are working. Here is a link on how to test the water valve. https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator+test-water-valve+repair.htm. You can also try to run the following test on the icemaker itself.Turn icemaker Off for 15 seconds and turn back on,Push in on paddle 3 times and only 3 times within 15 seconds of powering the icemaker back on.Within 3 minutes, the icemaker should enter the harvest mode.The heater will turn on for a about of 20 seconds, and the comb inside the icemaker will make one full revolution and return to the \"Home\" position.At the end of 3 minutes, the icemaker mold should fill with water.The green light under the ON/OFF switch should be on and steady.If this does not fix the issue you may need to replace the icemaker.

If the ice maker is not working, one possible reason could be a defective water valve. It would be best to check the water valve for any issues and consider replacing it if necessary. Additionally, other possible causes for the ice maker not working could include a clogged fill tube or fill cup, a malfunctioning water inlet valve, or an issue with the icemaker itself. It may be helpful to refer to the manufacturer's instructions or seek professional assistance for troubleshooting and fixing the ice maker."

       "1. Ensure that the ice maker is turned on. Check if the power switch or lever is set to the \"On\" position.\n",
