You might want to check the wheels on the brackets on either side of the rack to be sure there is no obstructions or the wheels are coming out of the track. You may have a bent track or wheel and bracket assembly. The rack should pull out almost the whole way. You can also adjust the rack by pressing the adjuster thumb button on either side of the rack.
