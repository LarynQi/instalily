      "Thank you for voting!      Jones  July 20, 2017   My icemaker just stopped making ice and I know I need to replace the water filter ive just been dragging my feet about it. Is the icemaker cut off now because I need to replace my filter or is there another reason for it stopping now?     Hello Jones, we recommend replacing the water filter every 6 months, depending on how often you use it. Replacing or not replacing the filter would only affect the water dispenser, not the icemaker. The most common reason an icemaker does not get water would be a defective water valve WPW10270395. I hope this helps.    34 people found this helpful.   Was this helpful?

Re-install on maker, it goes in one direction only, look at the configuration before you pull it out, and put in the same way. Make absolutely sure you re-install it so it clicks in all the way. If not, it won't work. I had to remove the ice maker again because I did not make this connection properly the first time. So I did the whole job twice. You have to put the job back in reverse of the way you took it out. The new one works great. I should have done this about a year ago. The old one had been making a noise and I ignored it.

Will the model # wpw10321304 work for it?  Thanks.Sherie\\nANSWER #3: Hello Sherie, thank you for inquiring. Door Bin PS11752778 is the refrigerator\\'s Lower Door Bin. The Upper Door Bin is PS11752309.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nQUESTION #4: Need the lower door bin. Please\\nANSWER #4: Hello Dhonna, Thank you for contacting us. I have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you are looking for is PartSelect Number PS11752778. Hope this helps!\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nQUESTION #5: What are the measurements pls\\nANSWER #5: Hello Gwen, your refrigerator requires the door bin with part number WPW10321304, it is approximately 14 1/4\" wide and 6\" from front to back. Please let us know if you have any further questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n---\\n\\n---\\n\\nQUESTION #6: Two of the door bins have cracked and won\\'t hold anything heavy.  I need replacement ones, but your site doesn\\'t list this model.  I\\'m afraid to purchase the clear ones you have available for fear they won\\'t fit.  Please advise!\\nANSWER #6: Hi Margaret,\\nThank you for your question.  There is a white plastic door bin listed under your model number.  The part number for it is PS11739091.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nQUESTION #7: I’m looking for meat pan, door shelf bin, crisper pan\\nANSWER #7: Hello Melvin, Thank you for your inquiry. The door shelf bin is part# WPW10321304, the meat pan is part# WP2188664, and the crisper drawer is part# WP2188656. Hope this helps!\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n---\\n\\n---\\n\\nQUESTION #2: I want to make sure this door unit fits my frig.  Not sure where you are measuring width--at front it might be 14 1/4, but at back it is wider and more like 16\"  also rather than 6\" deep, it is more like 7 1/2.  Am i ordering the right cantilever part?\\nANSWER #2: Hello Cindy, thank you for your question. We put all of our pictures of parts on a 1 inch square grid to help give an approximate measurement. At the front the bin would be about 14 1/4 and the back is a bit wider at about 16 inches. So part number WPW10321304 is the correct bin for the fridge door. I hope this helps!\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n---\\n\\nQUESTION #0: How do I replace this bin\\nANSWER #0: Hello Casey, thanks for reaching out to us. If the old bin is still in place, simply grab onto it with both hands and lift it away from the door, it should come right off. To install your new bin, line it up where the old bin was and simply drop it into place. Good luck with your repair.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nQUESTION #1: On my fridge door I have small shallow bins and larger deeper bins. I don’t know what they’re called but I need to order the larger deeper bin. Is that what this is?\\nANSWER #1: Hi Fin, thanks for your question. The large door shelf bin is known as a cantilever bin. The part number you need is WPW10321304. I hope this helps!\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIs this part compatible with my WPW10321304 model?\\n\\n-------\\n\\nIs this part compatible with my WPW10321304 model?'"

In side-by-side refrigerators, it is found in the top right corner or the bottom left grille. In bottom-freezer refrigerators, the filter is in the bottom left grille. In top-freezer units, the filter is located in the middle of the refrigerator. This NSF certified filter reduces 28 contaminants including pharmaceuticals, metals, minerals, pesticides, cysts, industrial chemicals, Class I Particulates and chlorine. It is made up of coconut carbon block and has three layers of filtration. The first layer is particle filtration that helps block larger contaminants. The second layer is micro-filtration, which prevents medium-sized impurities from passing. The third layer is called absorption filtration, which absorbs microscopic-sized pollutants. It measures 2 inches deep, 2 inches wide, 1-1/2 inches high, and weighs 0.5 lbs. To ensure your filter is working its best, it needs to be replaced every six months.

Do NOT use masking tape to identify the wires as they will have all stuck together by the time you go to reinstall them.   Most difficult process was removing and identifying the numerous wires to the back panel.  They have push connectors, but some were very difficult to remove.  The people doing the \"how to\" videos no doubt had them partially released and that made it look easy. Examine the connectors before removing to identify how they are captured by the connector.  A paper clip \"tool\" I made enabled me to release some of the capture lugs, but some were so tight, I had to use small needle-nose pliers to open up the lug to release the wire on the connector.   When reinstalling, re-tighten those connectors.Replacing the parts was much easier than the wiring disconnect/reconnect process.  I\\'m happy to report that replacing the rear bearing and the front 2 green and 2 white shim/bearings immediately and completely solved my problem.

The project took about 4 hours, which could have been reduced to 2 hours had I know about the clip release and wiring identification process.

But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you\\'ll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I\\'m certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience.

Next, the rear drum bearing I bought has a rubber o-ring which holds it in place. There is a good chance this o-ring will be hard and brittle after years of service, and will crumble when removed, in order to replace the bearing. I had to run to the local hardware store to get a new o-ring, and could only find one that did was not rated for high heat usage. I presumed once the drum is re-installed that the bearing can\\'t dislodge even with a missing o-ring. I think it just holds the bearing in place while removing and re-installing the drum, but I cannot be certain about this.So if you plan to replace the rear drum bearing, make sure to also order the o-ring that holds it in place. It is doubtful you can re-use the old one depending on the age of your dryer.Replacing the old white belt tensioning pulley requires the removal and re-installation of a \"nut\" that has no threads. It is forced on and off and not simple to re-install. The removal was easy simply by using a wrench to \"unscrew\" it counterclockwise. But re-installing it is another matter. It requires force to get it back onto the shaft. I saw a tip to use a 7/16\" socket placed over the nut and hit with a hammer while bracing the bracket from the other side. I did this by used a smaller tool, linesman\\'s pliers, which provided the force needed. Install it about 1/4\" past the end of the bracket shaft. Careful, that nut has sharp edges and I ended up bleeding from that process. Three hands would help: one to brace the bracket, one to hold the nut and socket in place, and one to hammer. So good luck with that. Probably there is a smarter way to do this.If you replace the old white plastic belt tensioning pulley with a new yellow one, it is not simple to understand how to re-install the belt properly. The videos do not do the trick adequately. I did find one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an', 'chunk': 7}, {'id': 'PS16542496-8', 'text': 'one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an \"aha moment\". Since you cannot see the belt, the pulleys, the motor, or anything else during installation, it is not a simple thing to do. Here are my tips: Before re-installing the drum, move the belt tensioning pulley bracket to the right (when facing the dryer front) and you will see a little spot where the bracket will stay to the right when engaged in this spot. Engage the bracket and then proceed to re-install the drum. That way, when you reach under the drum to set the belt properly on the pulleys, you won\\'t have to engage the tensioning bracket without being able to see. Once the belt is in place, carefully remove the bracket from the right holding spot and allow it to move back to the left operating position. I used two hands and don\\'t think I could have done it with one. When the belts are new, they can be naturally twisted and you have to be careful to install the belt with no twist. I had to do it twice to get it right. If someone can take up the top belt slack for you, it\\'s easy to feel the belt underneath the drum and get any twists out.Next, i had a hard time inserting the drum back into the dryer and finding the hole where the bearing inserts. The problem is, if you are not careful, it\\'s easy to move, bend, or break the heater wires which surround the hole you need to locate blindly and slip the drum bearing into. I did bend those wires, but luckily not break them.  In hindsight, applying some masking tape to the rear inside panel of the dryer right at the top, left and right of the drum BEFORE removing the drum would have made it much easier estimating the proper drum height while maneuvering the bearing into the rear hole. Then remove the masking tape when done. I ordered a new top plastic front bearing that supports the drum in the front. Good thing I did because mine was split about 5\" where one set of the green and white sliders install. I had one white \"plastic\" insert visible. The other one plus the two green bearings were totally missing. No wonder it was squealing.Finally, the hardest part for me was re-installing the top of the dryer!

Replace the new front bearing and put the new slides on the little plastic tabs, be careful so you don't snap them off. Green on top, white on the sides. Replace the lightbulb. Set the front panel into place on the tabs at the bottom of the dryer. Rehook the door wires (2), and have someone hold up the drum while you slide the front bearing into the drum.

Glad to be of assistance!', 'chunk': 19}, {'id': 'PS16542496-20', 'text': 'Product Description      BELT DRIVE Specifications  This Drive Belt is 89.5\" long and comes in black, featuring four ribs on the inside for a better grip. This is a long belt that wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pulley, allowing all the parts to work together, spinning the drum as the motor rotates. If the drum will not turn when the dryer is turned on the belt is likely broken. It is common for belts to stretch or become brittle over time, which is what leads to the breakage. If broken, it should be replaced; the drum simply cannot spin without this belt. Refer to your model number and user manual to check if this part is right for you. Ensure you use work gloves to protect your hands from sharp internal parts during this repair. Please note: When comparing the length of your old belt to the length of the belt as stated here, remember that a small amount of stretching and contortion may occur with belts over time for a range of different reasons. Unless your belt is drastically different in length, this belt is what you are looking for despite any small inaccuracies. You will need to remove power to your appliance, remove the main panel, and access the motor drive to slip your new belt back into place.

Loosen the front screw, but do not totally remove, unit will lift off of front screw. The back screw had to be completely removed because of a clip that holds the wiring on the back of the maker. The wiring is attached to the back wall in the form of what is called a Molex connector, a white plastic connector. This is probably the hardest part of the job, wiring access. The air deflector blocks any free access, so you have to just grab and depress the prongs to release the Molex from the wall. With wiring disconnected, remove entire assembly. Use a flat-tip screwdriver to pop the white cover off of the front of the maker to use on the new one. Same goes for the wire cube arm that sets out over the ice cube bin, taking the front out first (pulling straightout) then pivot arm 180 degrees and remove from back. Remove wiring harness from front of maker. Re-install on maker, it goes in one direction only, look at the configuration before you pull it out, and put in the same way. Make absolutely sure you re-install it so it clicks in all the way. If not, it won\\'t work. I had to remove the ice maker again because I did not make this connection properly the first time. So I did the whole job twice. You have to put the job back in reverse of the way you took it out. The new one works great. I should have done this about a year ago.

Is the icemaker cut off now because I need to replace my filter or is there another reason for it stopping now?\\nANSWER #1: Hello Jones, we recommend replacing the water filter every 6 months, depending on how often you use it. Replacing or not replacing the filter would only affect the water dispenser, not the icemaker. The most common reason an icemaker does not get water would be a defective water valve WPW10270395.

A customer replacing the filter may have clicked the wrong option in error.

But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you\\'ll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I\\'m certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect!', 'chunk': 3}, {'id': 'PS755842-4', 'text': 'Read less\\n                \\n                         Other Parts Used: \\n                        \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    Drum Bearing Slide - Green (Sold individually)\\n                                \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    BELT DRIVE\\n                                \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    Drum Bearing Slide - White (Sold individually)\\n                                \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    Rear Drum Bearing Kit\\n                                \\n                                     Show more \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    Idler Pulley Wheel', 'chunk': 4}, {'id': 'PS755842-5', 'text': \"---\\n\\nBearings completely worn out, including plastic.:\\n\\nInstall would have been easier if part was an exact fit.

Next, the rear drum bearing I bought has a rubber o-ring which holds it in place. There is a good chance this o-ring will be hard and brittle after years of service, and will crumble when removed, in order to replace the bearing. I had to run to the local hardware store to get a new o-ring, and could only find one that did was not rated for high heat usage. I presumed once the drum is re-installed that the bearing can\\'t dislodge even with a missing o-ring. I think it just holds the bearing in place while removing and re-installing the drum, but I cannot be certain about this.So if you plan to replace the rear drum bearing, make sure to also order the o-ring that holds it in place. It is doubtful you can re-use the old one depending on the age of your dryer.Replacing the old white belt tensioning pulley requires the removal and re-installation of a \"nut\" that has no threads. It is forced on and off and not simple to re-install. The removal was easy simply by using a wrench to \"unscrew\" it counterclockwise. But re-installing it is another matter. It requires force to get it back onto the shaft. I saw a tip to use a 7/16\" socket placed over the nut and hit with a hammer while bracing the bracket from the other side. I did this by used a smaller tool, linesman\\'s pliers, which provided the force needed. Install it about 1/4\" past the end of the bracket shaft. Careful, that nut has sharp edges and I ended up bleeding from that process. Three hands would help: one to brace the bracket, one to hold the nut and socket in place, and one to hammer. So good luck with that. Probably there is a smarter way to do this.If you replace the old white plastic belt tensioning pulley with a new yellow one, it is not simple to understand how to re-install the belt properly. The videos do not do the trick adequately. I did find one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an', 'chunk': 8}, {'id': 'PS755842-9', 'text': 'one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an \"aha moment\". Since you cannot see the belt, the pulleys, the motor, or anything else during installation, it is not a simple thing to do. Here are my tips: Before re-installing the drum, move the belt tensioning pulley bracket to the right (when facing the dryer front) and you will see a little spot where the bracket will stay to the right when engaged in this spot. Engage the bracket and then proceed to re-install the drum. That way, when you reach under the drum to set the belt properly on the pulleys, you won\\'t have to engage the tensioning bracket without being able to see. Once the belt is in place, carefully remove the bracket from the right holding spot and allow it to move back to the left operating position. I used two hands and don\\'t think I could have done it with one. When the belts are new, they can be naturally twisted and you have to be careful to install the belt with no twist. I had to do it twice to get it right. If someone can take up the top belt slack for you, it\\'s easy to feel the belt underneath the drum and get any twists out.Next, i had a hard time inserting the drum back into the dryer and finding the hole where the bearing inserts. The problem is, if you are not careful, it\\'s easy to move, bend, or break the heater wires which surround the hole you need to locate blindly and slip the drum bearing into. I did bend those wires, but luckily not break them.  In hindsight, applying some masking tape to the rear inside panel of the dryer right at the top, left and right of the drum BEFORE removing the drum would have made it much easier estimating the proper drum height while maneuvering the bearing into the rear hole. Then remove the masking tape when done. I ordered a new top plastic front bearing that supports the drum in the front. Good thing I did because mine was split about 5\" where one set of the green and white sliders install. I had one white \"plastic\" insert visible. The other one plus the two green bearings were totally missing. No wonder it was squealing.Finally, the hardest part for me was re-installing the top of the dryer!

Your belt could be the issue. If it has worn down so much that maybe it is slipping against the pulley.

They are all physical parts, so when you look at them you should be able to determine which one is causing the problem for you. The belt and the slides would be parts that get worn down, the pulley is just something that you turn the wheel on and you will hear if it is making the squeaking noise.

But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you\\'ll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I\\'m certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect!', 'chunk': 3}, {'id': 'PS6447706-4', 'text': 'Read less\\n                \\n                         Other Parts Used: \\n                        \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    Drum Bearing Slide - Green (Sold individually)\\n                                \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    BELT DRIVE\\n                                \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    Drum Bearing Slide - White (Sold individually)\\n                                \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    Rear Drum Bearing Kit\\n                                \\n                                     Show more \\n                                \\n                                      \\n\\t                \\n                \\n                                    Idler Pulley Wheel', 'chunk': 4}, {'id': 'PS6447706-5', 'text': \"---\\n\\nLoud scrapping sqeaks:\\n\\nDiagnostics, ordered front and back bearing.

I searched the internet for information on this issue and I found a YouTube video showing exactly how to disassemble the front of the dryer and replace the drum bearing slides.  PartSelect had created the video and included a link to the parts I needed, so I ordered them.  They arrived quickly and I was able to take the dryer apart to replace them, but when I did, I realized that the plastic piece that supported the slides had worn completely through.  I put the new slides in to keep the dryer going temporarily while I ordered a replacement bearing support, and once I put that in, the dryer was working like new again (no more thunderstorm noises and no clothing sacrifices).  I was very happy with the parts I got from PartSelect and also with their detailed, easy-to-follow instructions on YouTube.

For the green drum slides you can order part number WE1M1067, and for the white you can order part number WE1M504. Although only your green drum slides need replacing at the moment, we strongly advise replacing both the green and the white (upper and lower) together for an even wear.

It replaces the dryer\\'s front drum slide to allow for easier movement.  You\\'ll know if this part is an issue if your dryer is unable to tumble properly or is very noisy. Damage can come from regular use. As the slides start to break down it may cause your dryer to make noise or not dry clothes in the usual amount of time. You will need to purchase two for both sides of your dryer. They attach to the outer-most sides of the bearing. The manufacturer recommends replacing both slides at the same time. Take this opportunity to clean out the lint and dust in the dryer, to keep it running smoothly. This is a genuine replacement part that comes directly from the manufacturer. This item is sold individually. The part attaches to the outermost side of the bearing.

First you will have to remove your upper dish rack and the old adjust kit. Now, when installing the new kit, count 4 rungs from the back of the basket toward the front. Take your  new metal adjuster and thread the shaft through the fourth rung. You may have to tilt it to get it through. When you straighten the part the wheels portion should be on the outside of the rack and the shaft will  be on the inside of the rack. Take your positioner clips and use them to secure the adjuster to the rack. You will see two front tabs and two back tabs. The back tabs will also need to be tilted into place so that they are on the inside of the rack. The flat part of the positioner clips should be on the outside of the rack. Then you will push the clips down on to the adjuster to clip them into place. Now you will have to install the adjuster body on to the adjuster. Pull your adjuster all the way down. Tilt the adjusted toward the inside of the rack, you will notice that the adjuster body has a channel that will fit the adjuster. Slide those two pieces into place together. You will have 4 notches on your adjuster body that fit perfectly with your rack. Pull on your metal adjuster to lock it into place. Grab your actuator. You want to make sure that the thumb pad of your actuator is facing toward the inside of the rack and is closer to the front of the rack. Pull the adjuster arm up as far as you can, so that the body is a little bit above the top of the rack. The set the actuator inside of the two slots at the top of the body. You may have to tilt the body toward the inside of the rack to fit the actuator into place. Once you have that part in place, push the whole assembly down and press it back up against the side of the rack into place again. Now you will take the adjuster cover and install it on to the body from the outside of the rack. There is a little tab at the top of the cover, you will have to push that into place in the slot at the top of the adjuster body. That just snaps down into place. Then you install your two T15 Torx screws into the cover to hold it into place.

Check your model number and user manual to make sure this part is correct. It attaches directly to the dishrack. To repair, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dishrack. Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel.

Do NOT use masking tape to identify the wires as they will have all stuck together by the time you go to reinstall them.   Most difficult process was removing and identifying the numerous wires to the back panel.  They have push connectors, but some were very difficult to remove.  The people doing the \"how to\" videos no doubt had them partially released and that made it look easy. Examine the connectors before removing to identify how they are captured by the connector.  A paper clip \"tool\" I made enabled me to release some of the capture lugs, but some were so tight, I had to use small needle-nose pliers to open up the lug to release the wire on the connector.   When reinstalling, re-tighten those connectors.Replacing the parts was much easier than the wiring disconnect/reconnect process.  I\\'m happy to report that replacing the rear bearing and the front 2 green and 2 white shim/bearings immediately and completely solved my problem.

But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you\\'ll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I\\'m certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly.

Next, the rear drum bearing I bought has a rubber o-ring which holds it in place. There is a good chance this o-ring will be hard and brittle after years of service, and will crumble when removed, in order to replace the bearing. I had to run to the local hardware store to get a new o-ring, and could only find one that did was not rated for high heat usage. I presumed once the drum is re-installed that the bearing can\\'t dislodge even with a missing o-ring. I think it just holds the bearing in place while removing and re-installing the drum, but I cannot be certain about this.So if you plan to replace the rear drum bearing, make sure to also order the o-ring that holds it in place. It is doubtful you can re-use the old one depending on the age of your dryer.Replacing the old white belt tensioning pulley requires the removal and re-installation of a \"nut\" that has no threads. It is forced on and off and not simple to re-install. The removal was easy simply by using a wrench to \"unscrew\" it counterclockwise. But re-installing it is another matter. It requires force to get it back onto the shaft. I saw a tip to use a 7/16\" socket placed over the nut and hit with a hammer while bracing the bracket from the other side. I did this by used a smaller tool, linesman\\'s pliers, which provided the force needed. Install it about 1/4\" past the end of the bracket shaft. Careful, that nut has sharp edges and I ended up bleeding from that process. Three hands would help: one to brace the bracket, one to hold the nut and socket in place, and one to hammer. So good luck with that. Probably there is a smarter way to do this.If you replace the old white plastic belt tensioning pulley with a new yellow one, it is not simple to understand how to re-install the belt properly. The videos do not do the trick adequately. I did find one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an', 'chunk': 7}, {'id': 'PS16542496-8', 'text': 'one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an \"aha moment\". Since you cannot see the belt, the pulleys, the motor, or anything else during installation, it is not a simple thing to do. Here are my tips: Before re-installing the drum, move the belt tensioning pulley bracket to the right (when facing the dryer front) and you will see a little spot where the bracket will stay to the right when engaged in this spot. Engage the bracket and then proceed to re-install the drum. That way, when you reach under the drum to set the belt properly on the pulleys, you won\\'t have to engage the tensioning bracket without being able to see. Once the belt is in place, carefully remove the bracket from the right holding spot and allow it to move back to the left operating position. I used two hands and don\\'t think I could have done it with one. When the belts are new, they can be naturally twisted and you have to be careful to install the belt with no twist. I had to do it twice to get it right. If someone can take up the top belt slack for you, it\\'s easy to feel the belt underneath the drum and get any twists out.Next, i had a hard time inserting the drum back into the dryer and finding the hole where the bearing inserts. The problem is, if you are not careful, it\\'s easy to move, bend, or break the heater wires which surround the hole you need to locate blindly and slip the drum bearing into. I did bend those wires, but luckily not break them.  In hindsight, applying some masking tape to the rear inside panel of the dryer right at the top, left and right of the drum BEFORE removing the drum would have made it much easier estimating the proper drum height while maneuvering the bearing into the rear hole. Then remove the masking tape when done. I ordered a new top plastic front bearing that supports the drum in the front. Good thing I did because mine was split about 5\" where one set of the green and white sliders install. I had one white \"plastic\" insert visible. The other one plus the two green bearings were totally missing. No wonder it was squealing.Finally, the hardest part for me was re-installing the top of the dryer!

This is a long belt that wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pulley, allowing all the parts to work together, spinning the drum as the motor rotates. If the drum will not turn when the dryer is turned on the belt is likely broken. It is common for belts to stretch or become brittle over time, which is what leads to the breakage. If broken, it should be replaced; the drum simply cannot spin without this belt. Refer to your model number and user manual to check if this part is right for you. Ensure you use work gloves to protect your hands from sharp internal parts during this repair. Please note: When comparing the length of your old belt to the length of the belt as stated here, remember that a small amount of stretching and contortion may occur with belts over time for a range of different reasons. Unless your belt is drastically different in length, this belt is what you are looking for despite any small inaccuracies. You will need to remove power to your appliance, remove the main panel, and access the motor drive to slip your new belt back into place.

Part ps11756150\\nANSWER #3: Hi Val,\\nThank you for your inquiry.  Before beginning any repair please unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Release the track stops from the upper dishrack rails and pull the upper rack from the dishwasher and place it upside down on a work surface.  Raise the wheels to the maximum height.  Release the top of the long rear clip from the dishrack tine and push the clip down to the release point and remove it.  Press the tab down on the front clip move the clip up to pull it off. Release the locking tabs  on the clip in the middle of the height adjuster and remove the clip. Using a slot screw driver pry the housing cover down and out to release the upper tabs on each side.  Pry the bottom of the housing cover out of the 2 lower locking tabs.  Pull the housing cover off the rack.  Remove the adjuster housing and wheel assembly and repeat the procedure on the other side.  Slide the vertical portion on the new wheel assembly between the fourth set of vertical tines from the back of the dishrack and rotate the wheel assembly so that it lays flat against the side.  Insert a positioner clip above the rear wheel and snap the tab into the slot.  Install a positioner clip on the front wheel.  Position the adjuster body over the vertical portion of the wheel assembly and push in into the slots. Locking tabs at the bottom of the adjuster body engage the the wheel assembly once it is fully inserted the tabs.  Insert the actuator lever into the adjuster body with the thumb pad facing the front of the rack.  Two half circle cut outs on the adjuster body hold the actuator in place.  Push the adjuster body down and install the adjuster cover.  Install the adjuster cover mounting screws.  Repeat this process on the other side of the rack.  Push the upper dishrack onto its tracks.  Close the track stops on the rails and the repair is done. I hope this helps.

At this time, we do not have a video for this exact part number but I have found instructions for you. Use a small flat head screwdriver to depress the retaining tabs securing the rack adjustors to the tracks. Fully remove the upper rack. Using the flat blade screwdriver, release the tabs to detach the adjuster housing cover and remove the housing. Next detach the front and rear adjuster support straps from the tines and remove them from the rack adjuster. Note the orientation of the rack adjuster, then pry off the stop clip to detach the old adjuster. Install the new adjuster by aligning it on the rack and snap the stop clip into place to secure. Next replace the front and rear support straps. Position the adjuster housing by aligning the locking lever in the adjuster slot then snap the cover on to secure. Then put the upper rack back into place.

You would locate your model number on the left edge of the dishwasher's door, on the upper left hand corner of the unit's frame, on the top of the door jamb-to the left, right, or in the center, on the door itself, to the left, right or in the center, or on the underside of the control panel. Hope this helps!\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nQUESTION #6: I used the adjuster to lower the right side of top rack. Now the door will not close. I can't turn the dishwasher on.\\nANSWER #6: Hello Rochelle, Thank you for the question. I suggest putting the rack back to the normal setting in height to see if the door will close. If the door closes you may need to replace the adjuster. It might be causing the rack to come forward and not allow the door to close properly.

Grasp the filter and turn it to the left until it stops, while gently pulling downward from the filter head. Keep the filter level to minimize water spillage. (If the filter doesn't come loose easily, air may be trapped inside. To relieve any pressure, push in on the water dispenser; the filter should drop right out.) Remove and discard the plastic cap from the new filter. Fill the top of the replacement filter with water from the tap. Place the filter inside the cartridge holder by aligning the arrow on your filter with the cartridge holder. Push the filter gently upward to engage the top of the cartridge in the filter head. Slowly turn the filter to the right until the filter cartridge stops turning. As you turn the cartridge, it will automatically rise into position. After the filter has been replaced, trapped air must be purged out of the system. Select Water on the dispenser selector and press the pad until water begins to flow. The first few ounces of water may sputter due to air in the replacement filter. This is normal.

Do they sell the wheel and pin separately?  It seems rather costly for the entire assembly.\\nANSWER #0: Hi Lois, thank you for your question. Unfortunately no. The axle is not sold without the roller. We apologize that our prices are not as low as you expected. We base our prices on what we are charged by the manufacturer for the parts. We try to keep our prices as low as possible, but do also have to keep them at a level to help cover our costs. We hope this helps to explain the reasoning behind the prices!

It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs.

Check the fill tube and fill cup that brings water to the icemaker. It could be clogged with ice. If there is no ice obstructing the tube and cup, test the water inlet valve to be sure both ports on the valve are working. Here is a link on how to test the water valve. https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator+test-water-valve+repair.htm. You can also try to run the following test on the icemaker itself.Turn icemaker Off for 15 seconds and turn back on,Push in on paddle 3 times and only 3 times within 15 seconds of powering the icemaker back on.Within 3 minutes, the icemaker should enter the harvest mode.The heater will turn on for a about of 20 seconds, and the comb inside the icemaker will make one full revolution and return to the \"Home\" position.At the end of 3 minutes, the icemaker mold should fill with water.The green light under the ON/OFF switch should be on and steady.If this does not fix the issue you may need to replace the icemaker.

This part here would be the filter for your appliance. Good luck with your repair.', 'chunk': 7}, {'id': 'PS8746144-8', 'text': 'Product Description      Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter Specifications  This OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.
